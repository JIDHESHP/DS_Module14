# Ex2(B) Priority Queue
## DATE:5.03.25
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm
1. Start
2. Define a function printArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters.
3. Loop through the array from index 0 to size-1.
4. Print each element of the array during the loop.
5. After printing all elements, print a newline for formatting.
6. End 

## Program:
```

*/
void printArray(int array[], intsize)
{
int i;
for(i=0;i<size;i++)
{
printf("%d ",array[i]);
}
printf("\n");
}
```
